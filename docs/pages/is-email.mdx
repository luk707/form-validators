# isEmail

## Purpose

The is email validator is a loose validator that checks for the following things:

- Does the email have an at in it
- Does it have at least one period in the text after the at symbol and at least one character before and after the period
- Does it have at least a single character before the at symbol

It's purpose is to act as a catch all clause for text that clearly is not an email before you send it to a server to do more extensive validation i.e. an MX record look up.

## Example

Try out some email addresses of your own in this interactive example:

<ValidatorDemo validator={isEmail()} label="Email" leftIcons={["fal fa-envelope"]} />
